# rotationer
Software to build a custom rotation schedule.

## What's a rotation schedule?
For a specific event, we have groups of sales associates and groups of customers and their account managers travel though the trade show floor, visiting various booths for 10 minute sessions. These assignments of groups to booths are called "rotation sessions" and the full schedule of assignments is called a rotation schedule.

## This seems like something you can just do in Excel, what makes your 'rotationer' special?
Historically, the leaders of each group use an online capacity controlled registration form to sign up for appointments with a supplier at each time slot. Unfortunately, this process, while effective, was deemed too time consuming for the end user, and was not fool-proof. The rotationer takes into account a list of favorite suppliers, provided by the group leader, and the list of suppliers which shall be blacklisted for the sake of building the schedule, and with this data provides a randomized schedule free of duplicate bookings for all groups and all suppliers.
